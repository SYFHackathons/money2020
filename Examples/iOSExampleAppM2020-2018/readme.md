Welcome to Money2020 2018!  We conveniently include OAuthSwift via CocoaPods to make sure you don't have to worry about integrating it on your own, allowing you to focus on building your awesome idea.

This small sample app demonstrates how you can use OAuthSwift get an access token and then hit one of our APIs.  

Make sure to run "pod install" to integrate OAuthSwift. Happy Hacking!
